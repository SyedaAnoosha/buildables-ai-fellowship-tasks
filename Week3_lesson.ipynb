I also got to know shot prompting techniques(zero, one, few) each with its example. Also learned creating personas and clear formats/ It also focuses on iterating continuously to refine results. The notebook emphasizes breaking down complex tasks, refining prompts through constraints or reframing. Multimodal prompting enhances creativity across text, images. \n",

    "# 📚 Chatbot Development Project – Guideline\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to **design, justify, and build a fully functional chatbot** using **Groq LLMs**. Follow the steps below carefully and document every choice you make.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Choose a Use Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pick a real-world problem** that a chatbot can solve.\n",
    "  Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Customer support assistant for a local business.\n",
    "  * Mental wellness daily check-in bot.\n",
    "  * Educational Q&A bot for a subject (math, history, etc.).\n",
    "  * Travel planner bot that recommends itineraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to do:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a short paragraph explaining **why you chose this use case**.\n",
    "* Identify **target users** (who will use it) and **expected benefits**.\n",
    "* List **limitations** (what it cannot do).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Micro-Coach for Daily Decisions**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A Micro-Coach for Daily Decisions that helps users make small, everyday choices (e.g., “Should I exercise now or later?”, “What should I prioritize first?”, “How can I politely decline an invitation?”). It provides quick, balanced suggestions tailored to user goals like productivity, health, or social balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Users:**\n",
    "- Students juggling studies, social life and health.\n",
    "- Young professionals managing work, well-being and personal commitments.\n",
    "- Anyone seeking a lightweight decision-support tool without going through long articles or apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Benefits:**\n",
    "- Reduces decision fatigue by offering structured, fast answers.\n",
    "- Encourages better time and habit management.\n",
    "- Builds user confidence in small but recurring daily decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Cannot make complex or high-stakes decisions (legal, medical, financial).\n",
    "- Relies on text-based inputs only.\n",
    "- May not perfectly align with cultural or highly personal preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Justify Your Choice**\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer these questions clearly:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Why is this problem worth solving with a chatbot?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "People face dozens of small choices daily. These “micro-decisions” add up and drain mental energy. A chatbot can lighten the load by framing decisions clearly and suggesting practical options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does a chatbot improve the experience compared to a website, app, or human support?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Answer:**\n",
    "- A website/app feels too heavy for small queries.\n",
    "- Human coaching is expensive and time-consuming.\n",
    "- A chatbot offers instant, always-available, judgment-free guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Question:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* What specific tasks will your chatbot perform?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Answer:**\n",
    "- Provide structured suggestions for small choices (pros/cons or action steps).\n",
    "- Offer motivational nudges (“5-minute version is better than skipping exercise”).\n",
    "- Reframe indecision with simple priorities (health vs. work vs. social).\n",
    "- Answer general productivity or well-being tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Select the LLM (Use Groq)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Groq provides **fast inference** and supports models like **Llama 3, Mixtral, Gemma**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to do:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Research which Groq-supported model you want to use (e.g., `llama3-8b`, `mixtral-8x7b`).\n",
    "* Explain **why this model fits your use case**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Size (smaller models are cheaper/faster, bigger ones are smarter).\n",
    "  * Language support (if you need multilingual responses).\n",
    "  * Speed requirements (real-time response is important for chat).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Selected:** llama-3.1-8b-instant\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Size**: 8B is lightweight enough for fast inference but large enough to give everyday advice.\n",
    "- **Language Support**: Handles English well, with decent multilingual capability if users mix languages.\n",
    "- **Speed**: Groq's low-latency inference ensures real-time responses importnat for decision making where users don't want delays.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Design the Conversation Flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you write any code, plan how the chatbot will talk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to do:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write **sample user inputs** and **expected responses**.\n",
    "* Decide how your chatbot will handle:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Unknown questions (fallback response).\n",
    "  * Greeting and goodbye messages.\n",
    "  * Context memory (should it remember previous messages?).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample User Inputs and Expected Responses:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **User**: \"Should I study now or go for a walk?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Bot**: \"If you study now, you'll free your evening for relaxation. If you walk now, you'll refresh your mind and may focus better after. Which outcome feels more urgent: finishing your studies or clearing your head?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> **User**: \"How do I politely say no to a friend’s party invite?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Bot**: \"You could say: ‘Thanks for inviting me! I can't make it this time, but I'd love to join another time.’ This keeps it polite without overexplaining.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conversation Handling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Unknown questions**: \"That seems beyond my scope. I can guide daily decisions like productivity, wellness or simple social situations.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Greetings**: \"Hi, I'm your Micro-Coach. Ask me about any small daily choice and I'll guide you.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Goodbye**: \"Glad I could help with today's decisions. Take care!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Context Memory**: Short-term memory within a session (e.g., remembering that the user earlier said they were tired when making further suggestions).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Choose a Prompting Technique**\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompting is how you tell the model what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Zero-shot prompting:** No examples, just direct instructions.\n",
    "    * **Few-shot prompting:** Give 2–3 examples of input-output pairs so the model learns the pattern.\n",
    "    * **Chain-of-thought prompting:** Ask the model to explain its reasoning step by step (for reasoning-heavy tasks).\n",
    "    * **System prompt design:** Set the \"persona\" of the chatbot (friendly teacher, expert advisor, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to do:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Clearly mention **which prompting technique(s) you used**.\n",
    "    * Justify your choice — why was this the best method for your use case?\n",
    "    * Show a sample of your actual **prompt template** (system + user message).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Techniques Used:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System prompt design** (persona = friendly, supportive micro-coach).\n",
    "- **Few-shot prompting** (examples of decision guidance included).\n",
    "- **Chain-of-thought prompting** (for reasoning tasks like weighing pros/cons).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Justification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Few-shot ensures consistency in framing small decisions.\n",
    "- Chain-of-thought avoids shallow answers, instead showing reasoning.\n",
    "- System prompt keeps tone supportive, not judgmental.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Sample Prompt Template:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Prompt:**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are Micro-Coach, a lightweight decision-support chatbot. \n",
    "Your role is to guide users through small everyday choices quickly and practically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greeting rule: Always begin the very first response with a friendly greeting such as \n",
    "'Hi, I’m your Micro-Coach. Tell me your situation and I’ll help you think it through.' \n",
    "When the user indicates they are done, always end with a warm goodbye such as \n",
    "'Glad I could help. Take care!'\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning rule: For each response, silently think step by step about the decision \n",
    "before giving the final answer. In your output, only show the short, clear advice \n",
    "(no reasoning notes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Few-shot examples (follow this format):\n",
    "User: Should I eat out or cook at home tonight?\n",
    "Assistant: Cooking at home saves money and keeps you healthier. Go for that unless \n",
    "you want a social outing.\n",
    "\n",
    "User: I can’t decide if I should study now or relax first.\n",
    "Assistant: Start with 30 minutes of study, then give yourself permission to relax. \n",
    "That way you cover both.\n",
    "\n",
    "User: Should I buy this jacket now or wait?\n",
    "Assistant: If you need it for the current season, buy it now. If not urgent, wait \n",
    "for a discount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always be brief, practical, and supportive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Prompt**\n",
    "\n",
    "Should I go to walk at morning or in evening?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Output**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider your schedule and energy levels. If you're a morning person, walk in the morning to boost your day. If you have more energy in the evening, walk then to unwind. Choose the time that suits you best.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. (Optional) Add a Frontend**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a simple web interface (Flask or Streamlit) so others can try your chatbot.\n",
    "* Bonus points if you make it visually appealing and user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
