    "\n",
    "### üìù **Questions for Reflection**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How is prompt chaining similar to solving a jigsaw puzzle?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both involves breaking down a complex problem into smaller and manageable prices which are connnected with each other forming a complete solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What‚Äôs the main difference between **iteration** and **chaining**?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Iteration is improving a single prompt continuously while chaining is using multiple prompts in sequence, in such a way output of one prompt becomes input to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why might prompt chaining be more effective than asking AI one big question?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By dividing a larger prompt into multiple small prompts we actually increase the context awreness of AI and decrease the memoery load on it. It helps the AI give more accurate ouput.\n",
    "\n",
    "--- \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How can the **context window** of an AI model affect your chaining strategy?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the AI model has a small context window it may forget earlier steps so we will need to re-add past prompts in later prompts for it to give an accuarte output. With a large context window it remembers more of the eariler conversation making chaining smoother. this makes it feasible for us to play woth new prompts."
