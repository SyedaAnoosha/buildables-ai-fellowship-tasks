For example if i face a UI bug that is hard to explain i can take a screenshot and send it to the AI model which can identify and fix it. When I read long papers I upload them and ask the model questions such as what the results or discussion mean I have also used audio transcription in my app. it could also be useful for recording lectures and turning them into text later."
